USER DOCUMENTATION                                            kuse 0.0.0



DESCRIPTION:

    kuse is a simple but powerful flag manager for kiss. kuse lets you
    write build scripts that can enable or disable parts of a package
    depending on user choice, without having to deal with forking and
    keeping up-to-date.



COMMAND LINE USAGE: kuse <package> (list|has <flag>)

        <package>   The package to look up the enabled flags for.

    AVAILABLE COMMANDS:

        list        List all effective flags for <package>.

        has <flag>  Check if <flag> is enabled for <package>.

                    This command will exit with code 0 if the flag is
                    enabled, 1 if it is not.

                    If the flag is enabled, this command will also echo
                    back the name of the flag, to allow for easier use
                    in scripts.



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

        $USEPATH    The path kuse will look in for flag configurations.
                    (Defaults to /etc/kuse)

        $KUSE       Space separated list of flags to apply to all
                    packages. Optional

        $KUSE_<pkg> Space separated list of flags to apply to
                    <package>. Optional



FLAG CONFIGURATION:

    ENABLING FLAGS:

        The enabled flags for each package should be added into
        $USEPATH/<package> with one flag per line.

        To enable flags globally, flags can be added into
        $USEPATH/.global with one flag per line.

        To enable flags for all packages in the current process, add the
        flags in the $KUSE environment variable.

        To enable flags for a specific package in the current process,
        add the flags in the $KUSE_<package> environment variable.

    DISABLING FLAGS FOR PACKAGES:

        To disable a flag in a package, simply add the flag with a
        dash (-) before it into $USEPATH/<package>, $KUSE, or
        $KUSE_<package>

        The $USEPATH/.global file CAN NOT disable flags. A line
        beginning with a dash in that file will just be a recipe for
        weird stuff.

    FLAG PRIORITY:

        All inputs except .global can disable flags. If a flag is set on
        a later input, it will be re-enabled.

        Inputs sorted from lowest to highest priority:

        - $USEPATH/.global
        - $USEPATH/<package>
        - Environment variable: $KUSE
        - Environment variable: $KUSE_<package>
