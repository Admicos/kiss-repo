BUILD SCRIPT DOCUMENTATION                                    kuse 0.0.0



DESCRIPTION:

    kuse comes with a helper shell library to allow for easier usage in
    build scripts.



USAGE:

    To use the helper library, source it near the beginning of your
    build script:

        kh_package="packagename"
        source /usr/lib/kuse-helper.sh

    IMPORTANT:  $kh_package MUST be defined, as there are no other
                reliable ways to find which package this build script
                is for.



FUNCTIONS:

        kuse_has <flag>:    Convenience alias for
                            "kuse $kh_package has <flag>".

        kuse_if <flag> <if_exists> [if_not_exists]:

                            Prints out <if_exists> or [if_not_exists]
                            depending on the status of <flag>. Useful
                            for configuration scripts.

                            [if_not_exists] is empty by default.
